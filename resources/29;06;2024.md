### Sequential Circuit Logic
1. uses clock count as a method to keep doing a task
2.  needs a reset counter to take it back to zero.

##### Task: Sample counter example in TL-Verilog
```bash
$reset = *reset;

$num[31:0] = $reset ? 0 : (>>1$num + 1);
```

\>>1 means the previous value of ```$num``` value.
